# 🧠 Text Classification using DistilBERT (Hugging Face)

This project implements a **Text Classification** system using the pre-trained [DistilBERT model fine-tuned on SST-2](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) from Hugging Face's Transformers library.

---

## 📌 Overview

This NLP project focuses on classifying input text into binary sentiment labels — **positive** or **negative** — using state-of-the-art transformer architecture.

Key Features:
- Uses Hugging Face Transformers
- Based on DistilBERT (lightweight BERT variant)
- Binary sentiment classification (SST-2)
- Easy to use and deploy

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-classification.git
cd text-classification
2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Or manually:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install transformers torch
3. Run Classification
python
Copy
Edit
# classify.py
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis", model="distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")

text = "I love using this app! It's amazing."
result = classifier(text)

print(result)
# Output: [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998}]
✅ Example Results
Input Text	Prediction	Confidence
"This product is terrible."	NEGATIVE	0.98
"Absolutely loved the experience!"	POSITIVE	0.99
"It was okay, not too bad."	POSITIVE	0.88
