# 🧠 Text Classification using DistilBERT (Hugging Face)

This project implements a **Text Classification** system using the pre-trained [DistilBERT model fine-tuned on SST-2](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) from Hugging Face's Transformers library.

---

## 📌 Overview

This NLP project focuses on classifying input text into binary sentiment labels — **positive** or **negative** — using state-of-the-art transformer architecture.

Key Features:
- Uses Hugging Face Transformers
- Based on DistilBERT (lightweight BERT variant)
- Binary sentiment classification (SST-2)
- Easy to use and deploy

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository


from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis", model="distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")

text = "I love using this app! It's amazing."
result = classifier(text)

print(result)
# Output: [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998}]

Let me know if you're using **Streamlit**, **Flask**, or deploying to Hugging Face Spaces so I can add a deployment section too.
